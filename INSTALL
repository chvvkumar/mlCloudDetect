Installation in Python
To install and run mlCloudDetect in Python, create a Python virtual environment (to avoid various package conflicts) and run the application from a terminal window.

    git clone https://github.com/gordtulloch/mlCloudDetect.git
    cd mlCloudDetect
    python3 -m venv .venv             # Note that if the correct Python version is not the only one installed you should specify the version eg python3.8
    source .venv/bin/activate        # in Linux, do this every time you run the program to set up the virtual environment
    .venv\scripts\activate.bat        # in Windows

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 mlCloudDetect.py
